# PCA-Model
Principal Component Analysis has been implemented upon the USDA National Nutrient database to identify the key components contributing to different food products. 
Through this model, we have successfully reduced the dimensionality of the database from 21 to 12 components that explain a cumulative variance of about 92%

The database has been obtained from https://data.world/craigkelly/usda-national-nutrient-db
It is also available in the repository as a csv file.
